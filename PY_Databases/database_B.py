# Database Design

"""
Database design is an art form of its own with particular skills and experience.

Our goal is to avoid the really bad mistakes and design clean and easily understood databases

Others may performance turn things later

Database design starts with a picture

Basic Rule: Never put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead.
