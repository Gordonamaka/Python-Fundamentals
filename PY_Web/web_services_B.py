# XML Schema

"""
Description of the legal format of an xml document

Expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of documents

Often used to specify a "contract" between systems - "My system will only accept XML that conforms to this particular Schema."

If a particular piece of XML meets the specification of the Schema - it is said to "validate"
