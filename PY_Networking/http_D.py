Representing Simple Strings
- Each character is represented by a number between 0 and 256 stored in 8 bits of memory
- We refer to "8 bits of memory as a byte" of memory - (i.i. my disk drive contains 3 Terabytes of memory)
- The ord() function tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character
"""

print(ord('H'))
print(ord('e'))
print(ord('\n'))

# In Python 3, all strings are Unicode
